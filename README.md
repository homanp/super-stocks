This project is a POC on how to run custom functions/tools with Superagent. 

Big thanks to [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) for sponsoring us with access to their API. 

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm i 
```

2. Change `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the variables

3. Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
